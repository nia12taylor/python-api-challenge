Module 6 Python API Challenge by Mwohania (Nia) Taylor

Repo for UC Berkeley Data Analytics Bootcamp

## Background
This challenge began with starter code and allowed us to generate the desired outputs for two notebooks. Utilizing both WeatherPy and VacationPy Jupyter Notebook script  we could plot images based on CSV data.

## Weather Py
The WeatherPy.ipynb Jupyter notebook in the World_Weather_Analysis folder visualizes the weather metrics in several cities with varying longitude and latitude coordinates. The script creates a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

- Latitude vs. Humidity
- Latitude vs. Temperature
- Latitude vs. Wind Speed
- Latitude vs. Cloudiness

## Vacation Py
The VacationPy.ipynb Jupyter notebook uses geoviews Python library and GeoAPIfy to plan for a vacation destination. It creates a map of the cities nearest to randomly pick latitude and longitude coordinates. It also shows the humidity, max temperature, wind speed, and cloudiness in the cities. Finally, it filters cities based on specific criteria like temperature and cloudiness and locates hotels for those cities.
